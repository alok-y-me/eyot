The Flexible Network Layer Security (FNLS)
The existing network layer security tools like IPSEC are rigid in the sense that it provides same security to all 
data irrespective of its context. In FNLS, the applications pass down the level of security 
(depending on the context of data ) down to network layer - which implements the security mechanism 
(provides uniform, interoperable solution for all applications).
